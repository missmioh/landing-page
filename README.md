# landing-page
practice project - foundations

This landing page was designed based on the layout- and style requirements provided by The Odin Project.

- The header logo is already replaced by an empty image element so it is easier to modify in the future.
- The product detail placeholders can be swapped for images when maintaining the class name and removing the width declaration in the CSS file. See the comments in the source code.

Skills demonstrated in this project:

- Setup of an HTML5 boilerplate
- Structuring of the HTML elements to facilitate Flexbox arrangement
- Styling and aligning using CSS Flexbox elements, in typical use cases such as 
    - Navigation bar
    - Media objects
    - Form controls
    - Centering objects
    - Sticky footer
